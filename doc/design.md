# Heapsters: A hardcore-multiplayer PVP Infinite dungeon Rogue-like hacker game

Map structure: tree-like-graph
every dungeons has one starting node
unvisited nodes can spawn mobs/loots
Some mobs can be stealth over
Some mobs can be tamed

Every heapster has a camp-tent. He stores his stuff there and others can trade with the camp with system defined price.
Heapster dies, only stuff in his camp is preserved.
players can only log in on the camp spot.

Offline heapsters act as a PVP NPC. He drops loot when killed. 
If offline heapster wins a battle, he still weakens. 
If a heapster dont log online for certain period, he should be so weak and become an easy kill.

when heapster visits an unvisited node, there is a chance he enters the starting node of another heapsters dungeon (higher chance when tree height is higher, lower chance when heapsters in this dungeon are more). 
After heapster enters new dungeon, old dungeon with no one and no camps inside is removed from the system. 



If one heapster can reach very deep tree in a dungeon, he would know there are lots other heapsters behind his ass.
heapsters can add each other to friend list. 
heapsters can summon each other using a randomly drop item "recall scroll"
heapsters can join as a team. Team size has maximum limit to avoid unbalance.
Teams cant tame mobs.

heapsters can left tamed Mobs in any node, which attacks other heapsters on sight. heapsters would be notified where and when his tamed Mobs are killed by other heapsters.
Tamed mobs deployed to a node can not be harder to beat then a good team.

If heapster choose to go back, they will meet other heapsters, leads to PVP.
After certain tree level, the mobs will become so hard that all heapsters would be killed. Forcing heapsters to stay or go back for PVP to gain level.
