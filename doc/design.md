# Heapsters: A hardcore-multiplayer PVP Infinite dungeon Rogue-like hacker game


## basic
Map structure: tree-like-graph

every dungeons has one starting node

unvisited nodes can spawn mobs/loots

Some mobs can be stealth over

Some mobs can be tamed


## login, offline
Every heapster has a camp-tent. He stores his stuff there and others can trade with the camp with system defined price.

Heapster dies, only stuff in his camp is preserved.

players can only log in on the camp spot.

Offline heapsters act as a PVP NPC. He drops loot when killed. 

If offline heapster wins a battle, he still weakens. 

If a heapster dont log online for certain period, he should be so weak and become an easy kill.

## travaling
when heapster visits an unvisited node, there is a chance he enters the starting node of another heapsters dungeon (higher chance when tree height is higher, lower chance when heapsters in this dungeon are more). 

After heapster enters new dungeon, old dungeon with no one and no camps inside is removed from the system. 


## difficulty, gameplay
If one heapster can reach very deep tree in a dungeon, he would know there are lots other heapsters behind his ass.

heapsters can add each other to friend list. 

heapsters can summon each other using a randomly drop item "recall scroll"

heapsters can join as a team. Team size has maximum limit to avoid unbalance.

Teams cant tame mobs.

## tamed mobs, PVP
heapsters can left tamed Mobs in any node, which attacks other heapsters on sight. heapsters would be notified where and when his tamed Mobs are killed by other heapsters.

Tamed mobs deployed to a node can not be harder to beat then a good team.

If heapster choose to go back, they will meet other heapsters, leads to PVP.

After certain tree level, the mobs will become so hard that all heapsters would be killed. Forcing heapsters to stay or go back for PVP to gain level.


## control scheme
Heapster Mode: MUD like command only interface. powerful for magics, with auto-aiming abilities, and SFW.

Skill system for some newer classes could be based on math. Fire, Nature, Lighting, Water/Ice are corresponding to addition, substraction, multiplication and division respectly. 

Ex: a Lv1 fire skill would be a single digit plus math question, lv2 lighting skill would be a 2 digits by 1 digit multiplication.
